- The objective of the project was to compare various models based on accuracy, that can best classify the dataset into malignant and benign.
- Built models trained on logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and random forest. 
- By comparing the prediction accuracy of these models, it was found that model trained on logistic regression performed the best in   classifying the dataset.
- Tools used: Jupyter notebook
- Language: Python 3
- The data was provided by sklearn's built-in dataset.
