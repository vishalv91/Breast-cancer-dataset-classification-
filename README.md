# Breast cancer dataset classification

### Project summary:
- The objective of the project was to build various models and compare their prediction performance based on accuracy. 
- Built models trained on logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and random forest. 
- By comparing the prediction accuracy of these models, it was found that model trained on logistic regression performed the best in   classifying the dataset.
- Tools used: Jupyter notebook
- Language: Python 3
- The dataset was imported from the scikit-learn package.
